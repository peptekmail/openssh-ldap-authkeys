        It's worth noting here that this will build an "or" expression

        groups this may seem a bit concerning. This approach was tested at a
        1,500 person organization and extensive performance data was collected
        to verify that these large search queries are more sustainable than the
        alternatives of simply fetching all users and cutting down the result
        set locally, or fetching each user individually by calculating the DN.
        The caveat is that it does require your LDAP database to be properly
        indexed on the uid attribute, which is relatively doable in OpenLDAP but
